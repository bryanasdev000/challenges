# Challenge

As a Content Editor, you will be responsible for ensuring content is concise, straight to the point, and resonates with our audiences.

You received two blog posts written by one of our freelance writers. One is about [user-generated content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/160yeu9ygOQFk6cGWMLRwvua6DSsB1--SLuykjel5suY/edit?usp=sharing), and the other is about how [machine learning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlcr0X6Xf9-tx87wdwm06EBxvGK6DklTvUyT52LvRnk/edit?usp=sharing) can leverage personalization marketing.

Your task is to make suggestions to improve both, so they have no grammatical errors or typos and follow [our brand voice guideliness](https://croct.link/brand-voice). Also, one of them was translated from Portuguese. Make sure that there isn't any sentence sounding literally translated since word-by-word translations may not make sense or sound natural compared to how native speakers would formulate it.
